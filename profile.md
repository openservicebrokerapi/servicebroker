# Open Service Broker API Profile (master - might contain changes that are not yet released)

## Abstract

The [Open Service Broker API specification](spec.md) allows for extensions
and variations based on the environments in which it is being used; this
document contains the suggested usage pattern for some of those variants.

While use of this profile is OPTIONAL, an implementation is not compliant
with this profile if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST, SHALL
or REQUIRED level requirements defined herein.

## Notations and Terminology

### Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Terminology

Please refer to terminology defined by the
[Open Service Broker API specification](spec.md#terminology).

## Originating Identity Header

In the [Open Service Broker API specification](spec.md) it defines an
additional HTTP Header that can be included in messages from the Platform
to identify the user that requested the action to be taken.

The header consists of two parts: a `platform` string and `value` string,
where the `value` is a Base64 encoded serialized JSON object.
Both parts will vary based on the Platform which is being used. The
following sections define the values to be used based on the Platform
and which properties are expected to appear in the `value` JSON.

Note that when both the originating identity HTTP Header and the Context
object appear in the same message the `platform` value MUST be the same
for both.

### Cloud Foundry Originating Identity Header

*`platform` Value*: `cloudfoundry`

The following properties MUST appear within the JSON encoded `value`:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | string | The `user_id` value from the Cloud Foundry JWT token. |

Platforms MAY include additional properties.

For example, a `value` of:
```json
{
  "user_id": "683ea748-3092-4ff4-b656-39cacc4d5360"
}
```
would appear in the HTTP Header as:
```
X-Broker-API-Originating-Identity: cloudfoundry eyANCiAgInVzZXJfaWQiOiAiNjgzZWE3NDgtMzA5Mi00ZmY0LWI2NTYtMzljYWNjNGQ1MzYwIg0KfQ==
```

### Kubernetes Originating Identity Header

*`platform` Value*: `kubernetes`

The following properties MUST appear within the JSON encoded `value`:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| username | string | The `username` property from the Kubenernetes `user.info` object. |
| uid | string | The `uid` property from the Kubenernetes `user.info` object. |
| groups | array-of-strings | The `groups` property from the Kubenernetes `user.info` object. |
| extra | map-of-array-of-strings | The `extra` property from the Kubernetes `user.info` object. |

Platforms MAY include additional properties.

For example, a `value` of:
```json
{
  "username": "duke",
  "uid": "c2dde242-5ce4-11e7-988c-000c2946f14f",
  "groups": [ "admin", "dev" ],
  "extra": {
    "mydata": [ "data1", "data3" ]
  }
}
```
would appear in the HTTP Header as:
```
X-Broker-API-Originating-Identity: kubernetes ew0KICAidXNlcm5hbWUiOiAiZHVrZSIsDQogICJ1aWQiOiAiYzJkZGUyNDItNWNlNC0xMWU3LTk4OGMtMDAwYzI5NDZmMTRmIiwNCiAgImdyb3VwcyI6IFsgImFkbWluIiwgImRldiIgXSwNCiAgImV4dHJhIjogew0KICAgICJteWRhdGEiOiBbICJkYXRhMSIsICJkYXRhMyIgXQ0KICB9DQp9
```


## Context Object

In the [Open Service Broker API specification](spec.md) there are certain
message flows that include a `context` property. This property is defined
as an opaque JSON object that is meant to contain contextual information
about the environment in which the Platform or Application is executing.

While the `context` property is defined as an opaque JSON object, in practice,
it is often useful and necessary for there to be an agreed upon set of
properties to ensure a common understanding of this data between the
Platform and the Service Brokers.

### Context Object Properties

The list of properties within the Context Object can vary depending on
which Service Broker API is being invoked and which Platform is being used.
This section will define a set of properties for each Platform and specify
when each is meant to be used. Platforms MAY choose to provide additional
properties beyond the ones defined in this document.

Each property will include the version of the Open Service Broker
API in which it was introduced. For any API call in which that property
is mandatory, it is only mandatory for the specified version of the
specification or higher.

Aside from the Platform specific properties, defined in the following
sections, there is one common property called `platform` that
MUST also appear within `context` to indicate which Platform is being used.

The `platform` property MUST be a `string` and serialized as follows:
```
"platform": "platform-string-here"
```

Each section below will define the `platform` value that MUST be used based
on the Platform and the set of additional properties that MUST be present.

Note that when both the originating identity HTTP Header and the Context
object appear in the same message the `platform` value MUST be the same
for both.

To enable support for Platforms to send updated contextual data for Service
Instances, a Service Broker MUST declare support by including
`"allow_context_updates": true` in its
[catalog endpoint](spec.md#catalog-management).

### Cloud Foundry Context Object

*`platform` Property Value*: `cloudfoundry`

The following properties are defined for usage within a Cloud Foundry
deployment:

- `organization_guid`

  Version: 2.11

  The GUID of the organization that a Service Instance is associated with.
  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:
  ```
  "organization_guid": "organization-guid-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "organization_guid": "1113aa0-124e-4af2-1526-6bfacf61b111"
  ```

- `organization_name`

  Version: 2.15

  The name of the organization that a Service Instance is associated with.
  Note that the name of an organization in Cloud Foundry MAY be changed.
  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:
  ```
  "organization_name": "organization-name-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "organization_name": "system"
  ```

- `space_guid`

  Version: 2.11

  The GUID of the space that a Service Instance is associated with.
  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:
  ```
  "space_guid": "space-guid-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "space_guid": "aaaa1234-da91-4f12-8ffa-b51d0336aaaa"
  ```

- `space_name`

  Version: 2.15

  The name of the space that a Service Instance is associated with.
  Note that the name of a space in Cloud Foundry MAY be changed.
  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:
  ```
  "space_name": "space-name-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "space_name": "development"
  ```

- `instance_name`

  Version: 2.15

  The name of the Service Instance.
  Note that the name of a Service Instance in Cloud Foundry MAY be changed.
  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:
  ```
  "instance_name": "instance-name-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "instance_name": "my-db"
  ```

The following table specifies which properties will appear in each API.
All properties specified are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted.

| Request API | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| `PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id` | `organization_guid`, `organization_name`, `space_guid`, `space_name`, `instance_name` |
| `PATCH /v2/service_instances/:instance_id` | `organization_guid`, `organization_name`, `space_guid`, `space_name`, `instance_name` |
| `PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id` | `organization_guid`, `organization_name`, `space_guid`, `space_name` |

The following example shows a `context` object that might appear as part of a
Cloud Foundry API call:
  ```
  "context": {
    "platform": "cloudfoundry",
    "organization_guid": "1113aa0-124e-4af2-1526-6bfacf61b111",
    "organization_name": "system",
    "space_guid": "aaaa1234-da91-4f12-8ffa-b51d0336aaaa",
    "space_name": "development",
    "instance_name": "my-db"
  }
  ```

### Kubernetes Context Object

*`platform` Property Value*: `kubernetes`

The following properties are defined for usage within a Kubernetes deployment:

- `namespace`

  Version: 2.11

  The name of the Kubernetes namespace in which the Service Instance
  will be visible. This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized
  as follows:

  ```
  "namespace": "namespace-name-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "namespace": "testing"
  ```


- `clusterid`

  Version: 2.14

  The unique identifier for the Kubernetes cluster from which the request
  was sent. This property can be useful when a Service Broker tries to
  call back to a Platform that is managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.
  Typically this value will be static for the lifetime of the cluster,
  however, that is a Platform implementation choice. Brokers ought to take
  care that, while atypical, it is possible for the value to change over
  time.

  This property MUST be a non-empty string serialized as follows:

  ```
  "clusterid": "id-goes-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "clusterid": "644e1dd7-2a7f-18fb-b8ed-ed78c3f92c2b"
  ```

The following table specifies which properties will appear in each API.
All properties specified are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted.

| Request API | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| `PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id` | `namespace`, `clusterid` |
| `PATCH /v2/service_instances/:instance_id` | `namespace`, `clusterid` |
| `PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id` | `namespace`, `clusterid` |

Example:

The following example shows a `context` property that might appear as
part of a Kubernetes API call:
  ```
  "context": {
    "platform": "kubernetes",
    "namespace": "development",
    "clusterid": "8263feba-9b8a-23ae-99ed-abcd1234feda"
  }
  ```

## Bind Resource Object

In the [Open Service Broker API specification](spec.md), requests to
[create a Service Binding](spec.md#binding) can contain a `bind_resource`
object in which Platforms MAY choose to add additional fields.

### Cloud Foundry Bind Resource Object

The following properties are defined for usage within a Cloud Foundry
deployment:

- `space_guid`
  This OPTIONAL property is the GUID of a space that a Service Binding is
  associated with. If present, this property MUST be a non-empty string
  serialized as follows:
  ```
  "space_guid": "space-guid-here"
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  "space_guid": "15823972-c216-4ba5-9f3f-e75b0b891297"
  ```

The following example shows a `bind_resource` object that might appear as part
of a Cloud Foundry API call:
  ```
  "bind_resource": {
    "app_guid": "5e76c9bf-d5e3-46bf-9877-6d8dddfc8a45",
    "space_guid": "15823972-c216-4ba5-9f3f-e75b0b891297"
  }
  ```

## Service Metadata
