## Getting Started

The [Getting Started](gettingStarted.md) document provides a list of sample
Service Brokers, frameworks and libraries that might be useful to developers
wanting to implement a Platform or Service Broker.

The [Platform Compatibility](compatibility.md) document is a quick way to track
the state of current and pending feature additions, how they align with
releases, and which platforms are currently supporting them.

## Testing conformance to the Open Service Broker API

One of the [goals](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/#goals) of the Open
Service Broker API project is to **provide conformance test suites to verify
compliance with the specification**.

The conformance test suites below can be used to verify Service Broker behaviour
against different versions of the specification. If you are a maintainer of a
test suite which is not listed below, we would welcome a pull request to add a
link to it alongside the relevant information.
